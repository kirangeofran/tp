# BookMarked User Guide ðŸ“–

## Introduction

BookMarked is a desktop application designed specifically for librarians to streamline
the management of library inventory and borrower records. Optimized for use via a
Command Line Interface (CLI) while incorporating a Graphical User Interface (GUI),
BookMarked offers efficiency and speed in managing tasks. If you can type fast,
BookMarked enables you to perform inventory management tasks more swiftly than
traditional GUI-based applications.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have installed Java `11` on your computer.
2. Download the latest version of `BookMarked.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W13-4/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to your desired folder for use as a _home folder_.
4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, 
   and run the command `java -jar BookMarked.jar`. A command line display 
   similar to the one shown below will appear:
    ```
    _______________________________________________________________________________
    _______________________________________________________________________________
    
    Welcome to BookMarked, a one-stop app for all your librarian needs!
    To get started, you can type 'help' to see a list of commands!
    
    _______________________________________________________________________________
    _______________________________________________________________________________
    ```
5. Type some commands in the terminal and press Enter to execute them. 

    Here are some commands you can try:
    * `add book`
    * `list /sortby default`
    * `borrow book /by human`
    * `bye`
- **NOTE: all commands and arguments are case sensitive.**
- **Furthermore, all commands are space sensitive as well***
  - **However, all arguments are NOT space sensitive, meaning that if an argument was inputted as:
    `"           man"`, it would register as `"man"`.**
   
6. You can refer to the features below for the details of each command.

## Features
### Viewing all possible features: `help`
Lists out all available commands and their format.

Format: `help`



Examples: 
* `help`

### Adding a book to inventory: `add`
Adds a new book to the library's inventory.

Format: `add NAME_OF_BOOK (optional)/quantity NUMBER_OF_COPIES`

* If the /quantity argument is not inputted, the default number of copies is 1
* A maximum of 1000 copies of the books can be registered in total in the library.
* To add more copies of a book that already exists, simply type in the name of the book
  you wish to add, and type in the command per normal.
* For book titles, you cannot input titles containing special characters, or titles that are only
  numbers (eg. 7, 193, etc).

Example of usage:

`add The Book Thief`

* To add more copies of The Book Thief after it has already been added:
  `add The Book Thief` again.

`add The Hunger Games /quantity 50`

### Deleting books in the library: `delete`
Removes a book from the library's inventory based on its index in the list.

Format: `delete INDEX (optional)/quantity NUMBER_OF_COPIES`

* `INDEX` is the position number of the book in the list as shown by the default `list` command
  which is `list /sortby default`.
* A maximum of 1000 copies can be stored, and thus deleted from the library's inventory.
* Delete does not affect the books currently being borrowed by users, only those currently
   available in the library's inventory.
* To completely remove a book from the library, please ensure that all books are returned
  to the library before deleting all copies in the inventory.

Example of usage:

`delete 1`

`delete 3 /quantity 100`

![DeleteImage.png](images/code%20output/DeleteImage.png)

### Viewing books in the library: `list`
* Provides a list of books or users in the library.

Format: `list /sortby ARGUMENT`

There are four ways of sorting the list:
1. **Default**

   Format: `list /sortby default`

* Lists the list of books by the order which the first copy
of the book was added in regardless of their borrowed status or return date
* Outputs each book followed by the number of copies of each book in the inventory 
which is the number of books not borrowed, followed by the number of copies of each
book that has been borrowed.
* When a new book is added, if a book of the same title has not already been added, the
new book adds itself to the bottom of the book list
* If the new book being added already has a book of the same title which was added, the
number of books corresponding to the book title updates itself and adds a copy
* Eg. if `booka` was first added into the inventory, followed by `book b`,
the list of books will be as follows:
```
1. booka. Number of books in inventory: 1. Number of books borrowed: 0.
2. bookb. Number of books in inventory: 1. Number of books borrowed: 0.
```

2. **Alphabetical order**

   Format: `list /sortby alphabetical`

* Lists the list of books in the library in alphabetical order, in the same format as the `default` sort.
* 'Spaces' (" ") precede any alphabet, and uppercase letters precede lowercase letters.
* Eg. `book c` precedes `booka`, and `Bookc` preceds `bookc`.
* Eg. if the list contains : `booka`, `bookb`, `book c`, when sortby alphabetical is called,
the list is as follows: 
```
1. book c. Number of books in inventory: 1. Number of books borrowed: 0.
2. booka. Number of books in inventory: 1. Number of books borrowed: 0.
3. bookb. Number of books in inventory: 1. Number of books borrowed: 0. 
```

3. **By user**

    Format: `list /sortby user`

* Listing all users along with their borrowed books
* When a user borrows a book, the user is added to the user list
* Similar to list /sortby default, the users are listed according to their order
of being added to the user list. This is regardless of their borrow or return date
* The list of users only contains current users : meaning the list of users
is only those that currently have books borrowed.
* When a user returns all his books, he is deleted from the user list and
hence will not be reflected
* Under each user, the list of books currently borrowed by the user is shown
* The list of borrowed books of each user is sorted by the order of the book being
added to the user's book list.
  * For example: if the user borrows 2 books, `booka` and `bookb`
  but borrows `booka` first, `booka` will be item 1 on the list
* The output is as follows:
```
* User: tom
* Borrowed Books:
* 1. book c, Borrowed on: 2024-04-14, Return by: 2024-05-05
* 2. book a, Borrowed on: 2024-04-15, Return by: 2024-04-29
* User: mary
* Borrowed Books:
* 1. book d, Borrowed on: 2024-04-14, Return by: 2024-04-28
```

### Editing books in the library: `edit`
Allows for the modification of the details of an existing book in the library. 
This command currently supports editing the title of a book.

Format:

To edit by book index : `edit INDEX /title NEW_TITLE`

* The `INDEX` of the book is based on the output shown in the default list function and 
  should be the available `INDEX` in the library list.
* The new title of the book is specified in `NEW_TITLE`, and can be in more than 1 word.
* The title of the book, `NEW_TITLE`, is case-sensitive, and differences in case will
  refer to a different book.
* The `/title` tag is compulsory to put.

To edit by book title : `edit CURRENT_BOOK_TITLE /title NEW_TITLE`

* The current book title is specified in `CURRENT_BOOK_TITLE` and **must** be **exactly** specified as
  the actual current book title and is case-sensitive.
* The new title of the book is case-sensitive, specified in `NEW_TITLE`, and can be in more 
  than 1 word.
* The `/title` tag is compulsory to put.

Example of usage:
* `edit 1 /title The Book Thief`
* `edit new /title The New Beginning`

### Borrowing books in the library: `borrow`
Allows a user to borrow a book from the library's inventory if it is available. 
The book will be marked as borrowed, and a due date will be set for its return.
The return date is set at a default of two weeks from the date of borrowing.

Format: 

To borrow by book title : `borrow BOOK_NAME /by USER_NAME`

To borrow by book index : `borrow INDEX /by USER_NAME`

* The `INDEX` of the book can be seen using the default list command which is `list /sortby default`.

Note :

* Users do not need to be pre-added. They can be added directly when using the borrow command. 
* Each user can borrow multiple books, but they can only borrow one book of each title. For example, if 'Tom' has 
  borrowed one copy of 'The Book Thief', the user cannot borrow a second copy of 'The Book Thief', even if there is more than 
  one copy of 'The Book Thief' available in the inventory. 
* The username cannot any contain special characters.
  borrowed one copy of 'The Book Thief', the user cannot borrow a second copy of 'The Book Thief', even if there is 
  more than one copy of 'The Book Thief' available in the inventory. 
* If the specified book is not available for borrowing, or if there are no available copies left in the inventory,
  an appropriate message will be displayed.
* If there is more than 1 quantity of a book title available and two users want to borrow the book, the commands 
  must be typed separately. The command will only take the `USER_NAME` after the first `\by`.


Examples of usage:

Borrow by book title : `borrow The Book Thief /by Tom`

Borrow by book index : `borrow 1 /by Tom`

![BorrowImage.png](images/code%20output/BorrowImage.png)

* The `INDEX` of the book can be seen using the default list command which is `list /sortby default`.

Note:

* The due dates of books can only be extended if they are already borrowed.
* The system will output a message confirming the successful extension of the borrowing period, 
  along with the new due date.
